# ⏱️ Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts the estimated time of arrival (ETA) for deliveries or travel using real-world data.

🚀 Project Overview
This project builds a predictive model that estimates how long it will take to travel from a start location to an end location, helping businesses optimize deliveries, plan routes, and improve customer experience.

The model uses key features such as:

📍 start_lat, start_lng: Starting coordinates

📍 end_lat, end_lng: Destination coordinates

📏 distance_km: Calculated distance between start and end points

🚦 traffic_density: Current traffic level

☁️ weather_condition: Weather during travel

📅 day_of_week: Day (Monday–Sunday)

⏰ hour_of_day: Hour of the day (0–23)

It outputs:

✅ ETA (in minutes)

🛠️ Features
✅ Predicts delivery/travel time using geolocation and real-world conditions
✅ Incorporates traffic and weather for higher accuracy
✅ Supports batch and real-time predictions
✅ Ready for integration into web/mobile apps or logistics systems
✅ Provides visual insights on model performance
